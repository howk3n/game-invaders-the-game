//	Todo: One way to do it make all tick() methods receive a parameter called deltaTime (which is difference between current and previous tick).
//	Another way (which Unity uses) is implement a static class or singleton called GameTime, with a field called deltaTime. Game class would set that value in each tick,
//	and whoever needs that value can just check the GameTime class.
